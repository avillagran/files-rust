# Visible thumbnails — 0.0.4 in development

Grid and inspector show PNG/JPEG/WebP thumbnails and an initial video frame.
Only the selection and up to 32 visible sources are requested, never the whole folder.
A non-UTF-8 Unix name travels as bytes, without lossy conversion. The inspector's
thumbnail is the same entry that Grid draws; clicking it opens Space. Video
plays with controls in Space, not in each cell. Preferences can disable both image
and video thumbnails without disabling explicitly opened previews.

## Pipeline and local memory

One reusable worker with one active request/result: open FD/revision outside the UI,
reuse the bitmap if it matches the earlier revision, or invoke the existing engine
with expected_revision and check the effective source. Images use the shared helper;
baseline 12/24 MP JPEG reduces the IDCT first and samples to 160 px afterwards. Progressive images
that exceed 32 MiB of coefficients are still rejected: P02 stays partial.
Video shares the existing snapshot's FFprobe→FFmpeg and scales to 160 px; no shell,
no network, no nested processes. No new decoder nor new dependency/license.

The non-recursive parent watch reuses the MEDIA-LIFECYCLE worker: source mode
for Space and directory mode for thumbnails. Attach before authorizing demand,
and the job's epoch/token and ACK prevent accepting stale results. Any event
conservatively revokes displayed source proof; one FD probe per visible resource is
scheduled when its 1 s proof expires, to cover lost events. Since the flicker fix of 2026-11-04, during a periodic
renewal the last confirmed image is kept as a visual snapshot; it is
neither a fresh proof nor operational authority. Real invalidations
hide the snapshot immediately; an unavailable-source reply removes its RAM entry. A blocked syscall
does not imply a guaranteed deadline. No symlink_metadata/stat/readdir from draw/UI.
The final O_NOFOLLOW does not confine parent symlinks. Linux verified; the remaining adapters
are pending. A final FIFO/directory/symlink is not read as an image.

Single-owner LRU, accessed by borrowing during draw: no pinned Arcs outside
without charging, and no RGB cloning per occurrence. RGB Vec capacity (including the drained
wire header) + the active ticket of at most 80896 B share 4 MiB; at most 32 entries.
Reserved BEFORE decode and held until ACK/insert or discard. Cache keys
64 KiB counted by capacity+structure; demand 64 KiB checked by references
before clone/join. The sampling viewport is single and reused, at most 76800 B,
explicitly separate from the RGB ledger. Thumbnails are rounded 8 px even with
square corners: a CPU mask with edge coverage applied to the real image,
including letterbox. Painter is still software and creates no widgets per cell.

Hidden demand, navigation and Space revoke authorization and cancel active work,
but keep the bounded RAM LRU. A returning item needs a fresh descriptor probe
before its cached pixels can be displayed. Closing releases the RAM cache. Preview, du and Space
wait for the thumbnails to drain before another helper; du is deferred if needed.
Full Space does not reuse this LRU yet: it excludes it to avoid duplicating the
cache, keeps its earlier limits and separate pipeline/scratch buffers.
This does NOT yet unify every format/frame into a global budget, nor prove the tree's
PSS+Swap 50 MB/150 MB. P09 is still partial. Footer numbers
(main PSS) are not used for approval. Resources/startup NOT_MEASURED because of the explicit freeze.

Codec failures stay tied to the revision: revalidating an unchanged file
does not relaunch the decoder every second. Deletion/failure removes its bitmap; a replacement
with the same name/mtime/size needs the new identity. A lost event on
an entry outside demand is detected on reuse; instant deletion
without an event is not promised. RAM goes away on exit. The persistent cache described below does not sweep
other applications' caches. Saving originals in the Trash is a user operation, not a media cache.

The visibility gate uses FLTK's shown/visible_r: it cancels media and changes the token,
makes no new hidden decodes; when coming back it probes again and video returns
paused at the earlier position. Handler tests, not a native minimization test.
A readonly worker that cannot be interrupted may prevent the process from ending in the kernel:
no join from the UI nor new threads to work around it. Before allowing exit in the readonly
phase, a gate forbids any future spawn; the helper phase waits for cancel/reap.
The probe's ACK and the permission to close are kept distinct, with no fake full drain.

## Persistent cache and opt-out — 2026-11-07

`show_thumbnails` defaults to true for compatibility and is persisted with the
other preferences. Turning it off revokes visible proof, cancels admitted work
and blocks new thumbnail demand. Explicit Space previews remain independent.

The existing worker performs cache IO; draw and UI do no filesystem reads.
`thumbnail-cache-v3` under Files' configuration root has 256 direct-mapped slots
(1024 since 2026-11-10; see [THUMBNAILS](THUMBNAILS.md) for PDF/SVG and the shared cache),
each bounded to 80 KiB, plus one bounded unpublished scratch file. Hash collisions
are misses or ordinary eviction, never identity matches. A record compares the
full raw source path, descriptor-derived device/inode/size/mtime/ctime including
nanoseconds, decoder-recipe version, 160px dimensions, supported format, checksum
and 30-day age. Cache hits revalidate the same pinned source and current name.
Changes therefore cause a new decode; a known unavailable source retires its
owned slot with a small tombstone. Missing sources not visited while the app is
closed are not collected immediately; stale entries cannot be reused for a new
revision and total storage remains bounded to approximately 20 MiB.

Only compatible, owned regular files in a private descriptor-pinned directory
are accepted. Component and leaf symlinks are rejected. Unexpected/future files
are preserved and produce an observable cache warning; they are not overwritten.
Writes use one nonblocking cache lock and an atomic slot replacement. No fsync
is required for disposable cached pixels. Cancellation checks before commit
leave at most one bounded scratch file. The helper has reaped before entering
cache-write phase; close may abandon that phase without allowing another helper
to spawn. These local byte caps are not a process-tree PSS claim. Cache IO uses
at most one bounded encoded record plus one 160px RGB result as temporary scratch.

Private snapshots expose worker request/probe/decode/disk-hit and unavailable
counters, independently of the RAM LRU count. New codec, persistence, invalidation,
link-refusal, view-reuse and preference cases are prepared; their runtime
validation is recorded separately by the integrating checkpoint.

## Functional evidence

423 Rust (132 core/46 helper/245 UI), Clippy workspace/all-targets -Dwarnings and release
clean. The cache requires a ticket, counts capacity, limit 32/LRU, oversize rejection,
a late response after dirty discarded, error memoized per revision, preflight of
large input, an expired proof is not Ready, reused worker/ACK and the readonly vs
helper gate. A rounded letterboxed image and a reused scratch are tested with the recorder.

`evidence/thumbnails/thumbnails-ui-1793069315038209135.json`: scenario PASS,
three serialized instances and five real captures 1000×650. First: 7 visible
resources, JPEG 12 MP→160×120, raw filename, RGB shared with the inspector, a video frame,
Space→back, no new decoder in the stable interval, replace/modify/delete/Trash ACK,
folder change and callback with a live helper→exit 0. Second: notify callbacks
deliberately suppressed, FD reconciliation changes red→blue→callback exit 0.
Third: deleting its own C++ widget with a live helper→guard and drain→expected exit 1,
without a panic. 45/2/10 registered helper identities no longer exist after exit;
the observed concurrency 1/0/1 is not full lifetime coverage nor a budget.
Internal handlers and framebuffer, NOT OS input nor a real Super+W.

The earlier FAILs and sidecars are preserved: a Close marker missing from the instrument,
a legitimate ESRCH when the helper exited, a command before the first paint. In that last case
there was also a WidgetTracker panic, removed without a backtrace. Its original cause
is still open; a 20 s idle run with a backtrace did not reproduce it. The new guards do not
use a deleted window/canvas and cancel/drain through the failure path; the fixture
verifies that protection, not the cause nor the compositor. Do not claim that Super+W was
validated. An unexpected backend failure is not durable recovery of prefs/tasks
after a crash: X02 is still pending; operation errors/rescue are printed.

Pending: cache shared between documents/Space, embedded Markdown/HTML,
PDF/audio, other views/tabs/panes, native HiDPI,
minimization/OS input/offline and measuring the tree without concurrent captures/builds.
The earlier global FAIL/UNVALIDATED results remain; no 0.0.4 tag nor global PASS.

## Large visible PNG/JPEG — 2026-10-27

`python3 scripts/thumbnails-ui-check.py --large-codecs --normal-only`: scene
1793082861888227321 PASS with a 24 MP PNG decoded by rows and a 24 MP progressive JPEG with DC 1/8,
reduced to 160 px. It uses the existing engines/FD proof/cache; no duplicated
codec/cache implementation. The snapshot includes source_width/height and format to require
6000×4000/PNG,JPEG before capturing. 4 framebuffers 1000×650, Grid/inspector
share the RGB, replacement/delete/raw/Trash/navigate/Space/active close.
44 registered helper PID/start identities absent/reused, root exit 0; not full lifecycle
coverage. This command skips repeating the earlier notify-suppressed/widget-loss
fixtures; it does not replace them. 454 Rust/Clippy/release PASS.
Local caps unchanged, no new disk cache; resources/startup NOT_MEASURED freeze.
APNG/ICC/large WebP/global P09/other OSes/native 2x sharpness remain pending.


M16 GIF-PREVIEW reuses the first video frame/160 px and the existing LRU. Scene
1793098465429205562 PASS red 160×90 inspector, source 640×360/FD signature/real pixel and a
visible capture after closing Space (the last Space frame was blue). It is legitimate visible
demand, not a hidden loop; a GIF in the grid was not captured, so do not claim visual verification
of that surface yet. 485 Rust/Clippy/release, no resources/startup because of the freeze.
